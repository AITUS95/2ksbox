# wddm-install.ps1: the WDDM display driver on 64-bit Windows 11, test
# signed (track M20). 64-bit Windows loads no unsigned kernel driver, so
# this turns test mode on, makes a code-signing certificate of this
# machine's own, signs d3dptkmd.sys and the user-mode drivers (Direct3D
# 9's d3dptumd.dll, Direct3D 10 and 11's d3dpt11.dll, and their 32-bit
# copies for 32-bit processes) with it, writes the package's catalog and
# signs that, trusts the certificate, and installs the package on
# d3dpt-vga. Test mode starts at the next boot, and so does the driver.
# Run it elevated from the folder with the driver's six files; it copies
# them to a work folder first (the disc is read-only). Secure Boot must be
# off (the default with no keys enrolled).
#
# DWM composes through Direct3D 11's driver (track M25 step 4: the 11.1
# interface, WDDM 1.2). An earlier install's D3D11Exclude, which kept it
# on Direct3D 9's driver, is removed; d3dpt11.dll still refuses a process
# HKLM\SOFTWARE\2ksbox's D3D11Exclude names when it is set by hand.
